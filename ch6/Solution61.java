/**
*  Because we can only use the scale once, we have to treat each bottle differently. 
*  Assume there are 20 bottles, bottle #1, bottle #2, bottle #3 and so on. Take one pill from bottle #1, two pills from bottle
*  2, 3 pills from bottle 3, and so on. Weigh the mix of pills and get weight. 
*  Use the formula: (weight - 210)/0.1, and we get the number of bottle that has 1.1 gram pills.
