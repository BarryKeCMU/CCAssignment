/**
*   All the lockers are initially closed. In the first round, all the lockered are opened. In the second round, every second
*   locker is closed. In the third round, every third locker is opened. Thus we could see that if the number of factors of 
*   a locker's number is odd, this locker is left open after the 100th pass. Numbers with this feature are those called "perfect
*   square," including 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100. Thus there are ten lockers that are open at the end of the
*   process.
